# A novel framework for Visual Dialog (VisDial) 2022.11

Retrieve-based metrics on VisDial, i.e., NDCG, MRR, Mean, R@{1,5,10}, is not a good performance indicator in generative setting. We aim to build a network model for generating accurate, high-quality responses for Visual Dialog agent. However, we found that high NDCG and generated response quality are in the opposite direction.

# Comparsion of generated examples on VisDial v1.0 val split (2064 generated dialogs)

Please see all_generated_dialogs_2064_visdialv10val.txt, one example as follows: <br>
<br>
image_id: 82004 <br>
caption: a blue sign is set up at gas station that reads `` rules of the road ''<br>
-------<br>
round_id:1 <br>
		ques: can you read what the sign says? [ground question at round 1]<br>
		ground-truth: yes it is a list of rules<br>
		gen_answ: yes 【generated by Our new model】<br>
		baseline_answ: no 【Compared method】<br>

# Visual Dialog (VisDial) task
Visual Dialog needs an AI agent to chat with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a follow-up question about the image, VisDial agent aims to answer the question in free-form natural language.
